## 🐍 Python Development

### 🔹 Code Generation
```
Generate a Python function that [describe functionality].
Include docstrings, type hints, and error handling.
Example input: [example]. Example output: [example].
```

### 🔹 Debugging Code
```
I have the following Python code: [paste code].
It gives me [error/wrong output].
Explain the issue and provide a corrected version of the code.
```

### 🔹 Refactoring
```
Refactor the following Python code to improve [efficiency/readability/performance].
Explain the changes you made:
[paste code]
```

### 🔹 Unit Testing
```
Write unit tests for the following Python function using pytest.
Cover edge cases and invalid inputs as well:
[paste code]
```

### 🔹 Documentation Helper
```
Generate clear docstrings for the following Python function/class:
[paste code]
```

---

## 🗄️ SQL & Databases

### 🔹 SQL Query Writing
```
Write an SQL query for the following: [describe requirement].
The table schema is: [list schema].
Optimize for readability and performance.
```

### 🔹 SQL Debugging
```
Here is my SQL query: [paste query].
It returns [unexpected result].
Explain the issue and suggest a corrected query.
```

### 🔹 SQL Optimization
```
Optimize the following SQL query for large datasets.
Explain how the optimization improves performance:
[paste query]
```

---

## 🌐 APIs & Automation

### 🔹 API Request Template
```
Write Python code using the requests library to call the [API name] endpoint.
Use authentication [bearer/api key/etc.], handle errors, and parse JSON output.
Example response: [provide example].
```

### 🔹 Script Automation
```
Generate a Python script that automates [task: e.g., renaming files, sending emails, updating database].
Make it reusable and include error handling.
```

---

## 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization

### 🔹 Data Cleaning
```
Write Python code using Pandas to clean a dataset with columns [list columns].
Handle missing values, incorrect types, and duplicates.
Explain each step with comments.
```

### 🔹 Visualization
```
Write Python code to visualize [describe chart/insight] using [Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly].
Add titles, labels, and legends.
Dataset columns: [list columns].
```

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning

### 🔹 Model Training
```
Write Python code to train a [model type, e.g., RandomForest] on dataset with columns [list columns].
Include train/test split, model evaluation, and accuracy report.
```

### 🔹 Hyperparameter Tuning
```
Suggest hyperparameter tuning strategies for [ML model/library].
Give an example using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV in Python.
```

### 🔹 Explain a Concept
```
Explain how [ML concept: e.g., cross-validation, overfitting, regularization] works.
Provide code examples, common mistakes, and best practices.
```
